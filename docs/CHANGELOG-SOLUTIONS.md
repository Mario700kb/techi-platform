## 2026-06-12 - Device Tree subgroup counts use the full fleet snapshot

### Problem

Top-level client counts came from `/api/v1/devices/overview`, but the nested
`Servers` and `Client PC` counts were calculated from the currently loaded,
paginated Devices table. A client with 122 devices could therefore initially
show `Client PC: 1` or `0`. Clicking the folder changed the table filter and
made the number appear to correct itself from the newly loaded page.

The same partial dataset caused `Show empty groups` to display populated
folders with a zero count.

### Root cause and solution

`DeviceTree` mixed two count sources: complete overview counts for clients and
partial page data for child folders. The overview aggregation now includes a
`by_client_category` breakdown using the same canonical group and OS rules as
the server/workstation filters. It remains part of the existing count query,
so the overview still uses two database statements.

All tree levels now render from the same cached overview snapshot. Paginated
table data is retained only for row rendering and realtime maintenance
indicators, never for folder counts.

Persisted overview snapshots from the older response format are discarded
once, ensuring the first reload after deployment fetches the category
breakdown instead of briefly rendering zero subgroup counts.

## 2026-06-12 - Persistent session and shared fleet overview architecture

### Problem

Navigating through Dashboard, Clients, Operators, Audit, and Devices could
produce a visible `Loading session...` gate followed by empty tree counts and
stat-card skeletons. Devices table data arrived first, but fleet cards could
take 8 seconds or substantially longer.

Production access logs showed full document requests during the affected
navigation sequence. A document reload destroys module-level React caches, so
the previous in-memory auth cache could not prevent another auth bootstrap.
The bootstrap also made two sequential requests:

- `/api/v1/auth/me`
- `/api/v1/auth/permissions/me`

The fleet cards and tree depended on `/api/v1/devices/summary`. That endpoint
loads complete device records, telemetry, inventory, alerts, health details,
and patch details for the whole fleet even when the UI only needs a handful of
counts.

### Before

Production measurements taken on 2026-06-12:

| Request | Time | Payload |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `/api/v1/auth/me` | 1.70 s | 244 B |
| `/api/v1/auth/permissions/me` | 1.15 s | 352 B |
| `/api/v1/devices/?skip=0&limit=20` | 0.32 s | 41 KB |
| `/api/v1/devices/tree` | 0.31 s | 142 B |
| `/api/v1/devices/summary` | 22.81 s | 1.16 MB |

Consequences:

- auth bootstrap blocked the route for roughly 2.85 seconds after a document
  reload;
- the table could render while fleet cards and tree counts remained pending;
- Dashboard and Devices maintained separate caches for the same fleet data;
- Dashboard, Devices, and Remote Support could create separate device
  WebSocket connections as pages mounted and unmounted.

### Backend solution

`GET /api/v1/auth/session` now returns the authenticated operator and effective
permissions in one request.

`GET /api/v1/devices/overview` now returns:

- total, online, stale, and offline counts;
- tree totals and per-client counts;
- critical and warning health counts;
- average fleet health;
- devices needing updates;
- overview load timestamp.

The overview uses two database statements:

1. one grouped aggregation for freshness stats and client tree counts;
2. one joined, minimal health-input query for latest telemetry, inventory, and
   open alert counts.

The response is cached per operator scope for 30 seconds. The existing full
`/devices/summary` endpoint remains available for detailed reports, but it is
not used during Dashboard or Devices page mount.

A local SQLite benchmark with 700 devices completed the uncached overview in
44.5 ms with a 226-byte JSON payload. Production timing must be measured after
deployment, but this is well below the previous full-summary work and payload.

### Frontend solution

`sessionStore.ts` is a module singleton backed by `useSyncExternalStore`.

- user and permissions persist in `sessionStorage`;
- a page reload hydrates auth synchronously;
- one `bootstrapPromise` deduplicates concurrent session requests;
- auth data is removed only by logout or an HTTP 401;
- transient request failures do not erase the stored session.

`AppDataContext.tsx` is mounted once above the routed application.

- fleet overview persists in `sessionStorage`;
- fresh data renders synchronously;
- stale data renders immediately and refreshes in the background;
- concurrent overview requests are deduplicated;
- one shared device WebSocket publishes status and the latest event;
- Dashboard, Devices, and Remote Support no longer create page-owned device
  WebSocket connections.

Devices now loads its paginated table independently and reads all six large
cards plus top-level tree counts from the shared overview. Dashboard reads the
same overview and loads only its small recent-activity datasets.

Row-level health and patch badges load in the background from
`/api/v1/devices/table-details` for only the IDs on the current page. This
preserves table filters and badges without putting the full summary back on the
page-mount critical path.

### Expected behavior

- `Loading session...` appears only when a valid token exists but no persisted
  session has ever been loaded in the current browser tab.
- Route navigation never re-runs auth bootstrap.
- Reloading a tab with persisted session data does not show the auth gate.
- Devices cards and tree use one compact overview request.
- The Devices table remains independently paginated and can render without
  waiting for overview refresh.

### Verification

- Backend application modules compile successfully.
- The overview service smoke test confirms two SQL statements and cache reuse.
- The 700-device overview benchmark completes in 44.5 ms locally.
- The combined auth-session contract returns user and permissions together.
- `npm run build` succeeds after the AuthContext, AppDataProvider, Dashboard,
  Devices, and Remote Support refactor.
- The repository's local pytest environment uses Python 3.9 while existing
  backend code requires Python 3.10+ syntax, so focused pytest collection must
  run in the production-compatible backend environment.

## 2026-06-12 - Devices stat cards stay loading after a hard refresh

### Symptom

After an F5 reload on the Devices page, the paginated table loaded but the
Total, Online, Stale, Offline, Critical, and Warnings cards could remain in
their loading state until the user clicked Refresh.

### Investigation

- `loadTableData()` and `loadSnapshot()` own separate state. The table loader
  does not overwrite snapshot stats, health, patches, or snapshot loading.
- `loadSnapshot()` already handled an empty in-memory cache correctly: a cache
  miss continues to `getDevicesSummary()`.
- The six large cards all use `snapshotLoading` to decide whether to display
  their values or skeletons.
- `getDevicesSummary()` could successfully populate `snapshotStats`,
  `allDevices`, and `healthMap` while `snapshotLoading` remained true.
- The loading flag was cleared only after a `Promise.all()` containing both
  `getDevicesSummary()` and a redundant `getDeviceTree()` request. If the tree
  request remained pending, the summary-backed values existed but the cards
  continued to render skeletons.

### Fix

The snapshot loader now:

- waits only for `getDevicesSummary()` before clearing `snapshotLoading`;
- uses `snapshot.tree_counts` for the tree, which was already part of the
  summary response;
- no longer makes the redundant `getDeviceTree()` request.

```tsx
const snapshotPromise = getDevicesSummary().then((snapshot) => {
  setSnapshotStats(snapshot.stats);
  setTreeCounts({
    total: snapshot.tree_counts.total,
    unassigned: snapshot.tree_counts.unassigned,
    byClient: new Map(
      Object.entries(snapshot.tree_counts.by_client).map(([id, count]) => [Number(id), count])
    ),
  });
  setHealthMap(Object.fromEntries(snapshot.health.map((item) => [item.device_id, item])));
});

await snapshotPromise;
```

### Expected flow

1. The Devices page mounts.
2. `loadSnapshot()` starts one summary request for cards, health, patches, and
   tree counts.
3. `loadTableData()` independently starts the paginated devices request.
4. Each request updates only its own loading and data state.

### Verification

- Run `npm run build` from `frontend`.
- Hard-refresh `/devices` with the browser network panel open.
- Confirm one initial `/api/v1/devices/summary` request, no redundant
  `/api/v1/devices/tree` request, and one paginated `/api/v1/devices/` request.
- Confirm the stat cards populate without clicking Refresh.
